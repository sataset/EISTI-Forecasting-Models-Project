# Forecasting Models: Time Series Analysis final report

This is my final project submission for Forecasting Models in EISTI university.

## Disclaimer
It is not perfect, leave an issue if anyone will be interested fixing some problems and make code more universal. LaTeX document also requires several additions in theory. All tasks are completed by teacher's requirements. 

## Requirements
- Environment: `jupyter notebook`
- Python3 packages: `numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn`

## Pages
- [Datasets description](./datasets/readme.md)
- [Theory explanation](./TeX/final_report.pdf)

## To-Do
- Add all theory with explanations to TeX file
- Make functions universal for all column names
