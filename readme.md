# Forecasting Models: Time Series Analysis final report

This is my final project submission for Forecasting Models in EISTI university.

## Disclaimer
It is not perfect, leave an issue if anyone will be interested fixing some problems and make code more universal. LaTeX document also requires several additions in theory. All tasks are completed by teacher's requirements. 

## Abstract
**Time series analysis** comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data.

**Time series forecasting** is the use of a model to predict future values
based on previously observed values.
While regression analysis is often employed in such a way as to test
theories that the current values of one or more independent time series affect the current value of another time series, this type of analysis of time series is not called ”time series analysis”, which focuses on comparing values of a single time series or multiple dependent time series at different points in time. Interrupted time series analysis is the analysis of interventions on a single time series.
